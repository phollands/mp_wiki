== What's New in MatrixPilot 2.0 ==

  * Combines the functionality of MatrixNav and AileronAssist into a single firmware.
  * Supports navigation using both ailerons and rudder.
  * Increases the number of Radio Input channels (from 4 to 5), and Servo Output channels (from 3 to 6).
  * Supports controlling Delta wing and VTail airframes, in addition to Standard airframes with or without ailerons.
  * More responsive to switching between Manual, Stabilized, and Waypoint modes.
  * Supports using the new uBlox GPS for faster navigation responses.
  * Super-basic camera stabilization code.
  * Add serial telemetry output in a variety of formats.
    * Supports telemetry output in our own UAV Dev Board format.
    * Supports telemetry output using an Ardupilot Ground Station compatible format.
    * Supports NMEA output to a Remzibi OSD.

== Future Roadmap ==

As with all long term plans, these could change at any time, but here's where we're thinking we'll go in the near future.

=== MatrixPilot 2.1 ===

With this version we aim to include features that are either needed or helpful for users participating in the [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9016 SparkFun Autonomous Vehicle Challenge] on April 17th, 2010.  Plus whichever other goodies make their way in.

  * Improve robustness of launching while in Waypoint mode.
  * Improve robustness of following waypoints when losing the transmitter signal.
  * Possibly add support for absolute waypoints.
  * Possibly add support for automatic detection of, and adjustment for average wind speed and direction.

=== MatrixPilot 2.x ===

Other features being actively developed:

  * Stabilize inverted flight.
  * Stabilize vertical / hovering flight.
  * Stabilize knife-edge flight.
  * More configurable flight patterns.
  * Automatic landing.
  * Better camera stabilization and targeting.
  * ...

=== MatrixPilot 3.0 ===

Other features that are probably a bit further out:

  * Fully rotational based controls, using the complete theory proposed by Robert Mahoney.
  * Replace list of waypoints with a programmable flight / mission language.
  * IMU based "dead" reckoning.
  * Improve the mixing of manual input with stabilization controls.
  * Better Helicopter and quadcopter support.
  * Possibly develop a new revision of the hardware platform.
  * ...
