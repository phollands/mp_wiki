=== What's New in MatrixPilot 2.5 ===

  * IMU based "dead" reckoning.
  * Support for waypoints at absolute positions, relative to startup, or relative to a fixed location.
  * More configurable waypoints / flight patterns.
  * Stabilize inverted flight.
  * Stabilize vertical / hovering flight.
  * Beginnings of automatic landing.
  * Camera stabilization and targeting.
  * Support for automatic detection of, and adjustment for average wind speed and direction.
  * Support for using a magnetometer for yaw stabilization.
  * Improve robustness of waypoint following when losing the transmitter signal.


== What's New in MatrixPilot 2.0 ==

  * Combines the functionality of MatrixNav and AileronAssist into a single firmware.
  * Supports navigation using both ailerons and rudder.
  * Increases the number of Radio Input channels (from 4 to 5), and Servo Output channels (from 3 to 6).
  * Supports controlling Delta wing and VTail airframes, in addition to Standard airframes with or without ailerons.
  * More responsive to switching between Manual, Stabilized, and Waypoint modes.
  * Supports using the new uBlox GPS for faster navigation responses.
  * Super-basic camera stabilization code.
  * Add serial telemetry output in a variety of formats.
    * Supports telemetry output in our own UAV Dev Board format.
    * Supports telemetry output using an Ardupilot Ground Station compatible format.
    * Supports NMEA output to a Remzibi OSD.


== Future Roadmap ==

As with all long term plans, these could change at any time, but here's where we're thinking we'll go in the near future.


=== MatrixPilot 3.0 and Beyond ===

Other features that are in progress, or planned for the not too distant future:

  * Fully rotational based controls, using the complete theory proposed by Robert Mahoney.
  * Barometric pressure sensor for more precise altitude control.
  * Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation using a UDB and X-Plane.
  * Replace list of waypoints with a programmable flight / mission language.
  * Improve the mixing of manual input with stabilization controls.
  * Real Helicopter and quadcopter support.
  * Support for an upcoming new revision of the hardware platform.
