Matrix Nav controls a plane's elevator, rudder, and throttle to stabilize its pitch, maintain altitude and navigate back to the launch location on command. 

To use Matrix Nav, you connect your RC receiver's elevator, rudder, and throttle channels, and an available switch channel (often FLAP/AUX or GEAR) to the board's inputs, and connect the boards outputs to the elevator and rudder servos, and to the speed controller for throttle control.  This firmware also requires plugging a GPS receiver into the GPS socket on the board.
