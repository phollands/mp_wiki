Matrix Nav controls a plane's elevator and rudder to stabilize its pitch, and navigate back to the launch location on command. 

To use Matrix Nav, you connect your RC receiver's elevator and rudder channels, and an available switch channel (often FLAP/AUX or GEAR) to 3 of the board's inputs, and connect 2 of the boards outputs to the elevator and rudder servos.  This firmware also requires plugging a GPS receiver into the GPS socket on the board.
