= Overview =

The existing Red and Green boards only include built in connections for 4 Radio Input channels, and 3 Servo Output channels.

Here's how to connect the 5th Input channel, and the 4th, 5th, and 6th Output channels.

_First, note that this is still development code, and you should do a lot of testing and probably email the list before you actually fly with this code._

The new Input runs on pin RE8.  The new outputs on RE0, RE2, and RE4.  This pins are made available along the bottom-left edge of the board  To use these pins as a radio input and servo outputs, here's what I suggest doing:

  * Find, re-purpose, or buy 3 male-to-female servo extension cables
  * Near the middle of each cable, separate the Orange (signal) wire from the other two for a distance of a couple inches
  * Cut only the orange wire near the middle of the cable
  * Strip the two new ends of the orange wire
  * Either by soldering directly to the board, or through a 4-pin header and connector, make the following connections:
  * Take one cable and connect the orange wire that is connected to the female end(1) to RE8.  This female end will be Input 5.
  * Connect the other orange wire from that cable (connected to the male end) to RE0.  This male end will be Output 4.
  * Connect the orange wire that's connected to the male end of the next cable to RE2.  This male end will be Output 5.
  * Connect the orange wire that's connected to the male end of the last cable to RE4.  This male end will be Output 6.
  * Separately tape up each of the 2 unused ends that connect to the female ends of the 2nd and 3rd cables so they won't short on anything.  If you read through all the directions before starting, good job!  Your reward is that you can skip stripping these two remaining ends a few steps ago.

(1) Note: I'm calling the below pictured connector female.  This is the end that usually comes attached to servos, and that usually plugs into a receiver.

Now to use these cables, connect the new Input 5 to a channel you want to use on your receiver.  And attach the other two female ends to 2 unused channels on your receiver.  (You can connect one of them to the BATT connection on the receiver, if that is unused in your setup.)  Note that these two channels are only being used for power, and the values from the receiver on these channels is being ignored.  Now you can connect servos to the other ends of these cables, and they will be driven as output channels 4, 5, and 6.
