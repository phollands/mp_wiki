Aileron Assist controls a plane's elevator, ailerons, and throttle to stabilize a plane's pitch and roll, maintain altitude, and to navigate back to the launch location on command.

To set up Aileron Assist, you connect your RC receiver's elevator, aileron, and throttle channels, and an available switch channel (often FLAP/AUX or GEAR) to the board's inputs, and connect the board's outputs to the elevator and aileron servos, and to the speed controller for throttle control.  This firmware also requires plugging a GPS receiver into the GPS socket on the board.

_It is recommended that AileronAssist users upgrade to MatrixPilot for better support._
