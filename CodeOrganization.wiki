Here's some brief info on how to get started digging into the MatrixPilot code base.

First of all, as of MatrixPilot 3.0, the code is divided into a few sections:
  * *libUDB* is the library that interfaces with the UAVDevBoard hardware, and gives you easy access to things like RC inputs, servo outputs, serial ports, LEDs, and gyro and accelerometer data.
  * *libDCM* is a library that uses libUDB, and implements a Direction Cosine Matrix, which keeps track of the attitude/orientation and location of the plane.
  * *MatrixPilot* is an application that uses the above 2 libraries to control an RC plane.

One of the best ways to learn about the architecture of MatrixPilot is to study the interrupt service routines. MatrixPilot is run completely from interrupts and their timers. The interrupts are described in [https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=133ByuhulBTqxOuNHdbLf0cYfeiKzBoP4jNg_rGOAYpM an online document here]  ( [http://code.google.com/p/gentlenav/downloads/detail?name=AnIntroductiontoMatrixPilotInterrupts.pdf&can=2&q= PDF version here]).
