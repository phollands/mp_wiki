# In-Progress, Experimental, and Otherwise Unreleased Features

There is lots of cool research and development going on besides what's already released in MatrixPilot.  Here are links to a few of these projects.

  * Adding multirotor support
  * Adding support for [Software-In-the-Loop Simulation](SoftwareInLoop.md) (completed)
  * Work towards the NASA UAS Airspace Operations Challenge (stagnant)
  * [Integrating an IP stack into MatrixPilot](TCPIPnetwork.md) (stagnant)
  * Adding support for more sensors
  * Adding support for complex on-board mixing
  * Adding a fly-by-wire mode
  * Adding the ability to fly through temporary GPS-failures
  * Testing, documenting and releasing support for external microSD cards connected to the external SPI bus
  * Completing file system support for microSD cards on UDB4/5 and both external microSD and internal flash memory on the AUAV3
  * Completing work on dynamic configuration files on the file system(s)
  * Completing work for support of RFM22B breakout boards providing a directly integrated (external SPI bus) remote control receiver compatible with the openLRS project
  * Integrating LOGO interpreter in order to support LOGO script files stored on file system (aka, no source rebuild/load required in order to modify LOGO flightplans)
  * Adding support for the uBlox NEO-6T GPS thereby providing centimeter precision position services (requires a static groundstation)
  * Adding MAVLink FTP support
