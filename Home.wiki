The UAV Dev Board, designed by Bill Premerlani, is an IMU-based development platform for building controllers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  This site hosts the development of UAV code that runs on this board, allowing it to stabilize an airplane, maintain altitude, and optionally navigate back to the launch site.

*MatrixPilot 2.0.3 - Thursday, March 11, 2010*

Version 2.0.3 fixes two bugs associated with certain types of receivers that do not have a fail-safe. These receivers typically produce random pulses when your transmitter is off.  Users of MatrixPilot with such receivers should upgrade to 2.0.3, which eliminates a glitch in the control surfaces when you shut off your transmitter, and prevents a rare, but serious "lockup" of a PWM input channel if it receives a string of closely spaced, extremely narrow pulses. Also, if you have transmitters in your plane, such as for video or telemetry, that might interfere with your receiver, you should use version 2.0.3.

== Hardware Specifications ==
This board comes with a dsPIC30F4011 CPU, an MMA7260 three axis accelerometer and 3 LISY300AL gyros already soldered as shown in the picture. It is intended for the do-it-yourselfer. By itself, it can be used to develop a three axis IMU controller. With the addition of a GPS receiver, it can be used to develop a UAV controller for an RC car, plane, or boat.  All firmware versions are compatible with the [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=465 EM406 GPS].

== UAV Dev Board Firmwares ==

For info on the latest developments and future plans, check out the ProjectStatus page.

|| *MatrixPilot* || *!MatrixPilot is the latest branch of the firmware for the UAV Dev Board.  It is a recommended upgrade from both MatrixNav and AileronAssist.  It offers up to 5 input channels and 6 output channels, control of Delta Wing and V-Tail airframes, allows much more configuration, plus a bunch of other cool new features too.* ||
|| AileronAssist || Aileron Assist controls a plane's elevator and ailerons to stabilize a plane's pitch and roll, and to navigate back to the launch location on command.  It is recommended that AileronAssist users upgrade to MatrixPilot for better support. ||
|| MatrixNav || Matrix Nav controls a plane's elevator and rudder to stabilize its pitch, and navigate back to the launch location on command.  It is recommended that MatrixNav users upgrade to MatrixPilot for better support. ||
|| RollPitchYaw || The Roll Pitch Yaw firmware is not meant for flying. It's a test program that drives three servos proportionally to the current roll, pitch, and yaw of the UAV Dev Board. It also sends serial data about it's orientation out the TX pin, which can be useful for visualizations on a computer.  ||
|| [UAVSelfTest UAVSelfTest] || The UAVSelfTest firmware lets you test that your dev board hardware is functioning properly. It helps you test the receiver channels, the servo channels, the gyros, accelerometers, LEDs, and switches. ||
