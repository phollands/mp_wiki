MatrixPilot can be configured to fly to specific waypoints, and as of MatrixPilot 3.0, you can alternately program MatrixPilot to fly a path defined by a LOGO program, interpreted on-board.

Using either method, MatrixPilot can be set up with 2 flight plans.  The main flight plan is used when flipping the mode switch to Waypoint mode.  The RTL flight plan is initiated when the UDB detects that it has lost the RC signal from your RC transmitter.  Traditionally this flight plan is set up to turn off the throttle and head home, but you can customize this just as much as you can customize the main flight plan.
