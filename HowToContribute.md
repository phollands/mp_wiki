## Help test the latest, unreleased code

You can grab the latest development code by checking out a copy using subversion from the gentlenav google code site.  You can find our instructions for using subversion [here](UsingSubversion.md).  If you run development code, you should also subscribe to the [uavdevboard google group](http://groups.google.com/group/uavdevboard) to keep up to date with the problems, fixes, and changes going into the code.


## Contribute your working configuration

We'd like to keep a repository of good, working options.h configurations along with description of the plane that each configuration works with.  If you've got a setup that's different than the other ones in the repository, and you have your plane working well with the latest release or development code, we'd love it if you would send us a copy of your options.h to share.


## Help answer questions on the uavdevboard google group

This group is our primary arena for discussing development and answering user questions.


## Help us keep this Wiki site up to date

If you feel like you have a good handle of the current state and active development of the project, you could help us keep this Wiki site up to date.  Email the uavdevboard list to learn how to help.


## Contribute code

To contribute changes, improvements, or new features to the code, you should make sure you're running the latest development version of the code from the subversion repository.  [More info here](UsingSubversion.md).
