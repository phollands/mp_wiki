The UAV Dev Board, designed by Bill Premerlani, is an IMU-based development platform for building controllers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  This site hosts the development of UAV code that runs on this board, allowing it to stabilize an airplane, maintain altitude, and navigate to specific locations, or back to the launch site.

== Hardware Specifications ==
This board comes with a dsPIC30F4011 CPU, an MMA7260 three axis accelerometer and two dual-axis Inversense IXZ500 gyroscopes already soldered as shown in the picture. It is intended for the do-it-yourselfer. By itself, it can be used to develop a three axis IMU controller. With the addition of a GPS receiver, it can be used to develop a UAV controller for an RC car, plane, or boat.  All firmware versions are compatible with the [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=465 EM406 GPS].  The new MatrixPilot firmware can also use the [http://store.diydrones.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=SPK-GPS-GS407 uBlox 5H GPS], but the developers currently recommend using the [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=465 EM406].
