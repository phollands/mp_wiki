Here is a list of the software tools that we use along with the UDB and MatrixPilot.

  * *[FlightAnalyzer Flan (FLight ANalyzer)]*:  This tool takes telemetry logs from a flight, and converts them into .kmz files for viewing in Google Earth, and into .csv files for importing into a spreadsheet for analysis. Flan will work with the SERIAL_UDB_EXTRA as well as SERIAL_MAVLINK formatted telemetry to produce useful Google Earth views of your flight.

    * Ardupilot GCS

  * *[HardwareInLoop XPlane Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation]*: MatrixPilot can run using a virtual plane and virtual sensors, running inside the XPlane simulator.
