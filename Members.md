# UDB Members and Our Planes

This is a repository with some info about the pilots and planes in the UDB community.  It's fun to learn a bit about each other, and it can be very useful to be able to learn from each other's experience when setting up a new plane.

MatrixPilot is able to control a wide variety of airframes.  To help us make sure the code keeps working correctly for lots of different configurations, it helps to know who's able to test what kinds of planes.  So if you're up for helping us test, let us know a bit about your plane/s and we'll add you to this list.

Inverted.  Inputs: Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Mode, Rudder.  Outputs: Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Rudder, 2nd Aileron. | UDB Gyros pick up some RFI from the XBee. | current trunk        | [ben-minimag-options.h](http://gentlenav.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/members/ben-minimag-options.h) |

Inverted.  Hovering.  Inputs: Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Mode, Rudder.  Outputs: Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Rudder, 2nd Aileron. | Problem: It crashed at the SparkFun AVC, so it needs rebuilding... | current trunk        | [ben-acromaster-options.h](http://gentlenav.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/members/ben-acromaster-options.h) |
| Sid        | Custom made glider type airframe with Rudder + elevator (hand launched) ![http://gentlenav.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/members/sid-chemo.jpeg](http://gentlenav.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/members/sid-chemo.jpeg) | Red Board, Futaba 9Cap, Thomas Schurrer UHF rc, Remzibi OSD, Video Tx 2.4 Ghz / UHF rx Antenna converted from flexible wire to rubbuer duck | Standard Airframe.  Inputs: Throttle, Elevator, Mode, Rudder.  Outputs: Throttle, Elevator, Rudder. | NO major issues yet.. Have flown this setup more then 65 hours... Maybe more...  I am still using R141 (on Google Code) version on my airplane and I find it is very much reliable.. I can have coffee w/o looking at her when while she is doing RTL overhead till the battery lasts. NO Joke I actually do that sometimes. I am successfully using same battery to power motor , udb and my video gear by adding some ferrite rings w/o any problems.. NO degradation on the range etc.. Perhaps I have enough distance to keep things apart. | r141 (on Google Code) | [sid-custom-options.h](http://gentlenav.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/members/sid-custom-options.h) |
